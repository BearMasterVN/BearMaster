## **Introduction to BearMaster¬ÆÔ∏è**
> BearMaster was created on August 1, 2021. That morning, like every other morning, I was chatting with friends on the server I was working on. I heard a friend of mine mention bot discord, I liked it so much, I asked him if I could make a bot? He told me yes, but I had to know how to code. I was quite annoyed because at the time I didn't even know what the code was, I went online, the servers involved in creating discord bots and I did a lot of research. After doing some research, I started creating and testing some bots. Until August 1st, I decided to create BearMaster. A rather reckless decision when I have only been coding for a month, I have encountered a lot of difficulties. It's been working for 5 months now, I still have a lot to learn to keep developing more things for it. Thank you very much to our customers for trusting us in the past.
